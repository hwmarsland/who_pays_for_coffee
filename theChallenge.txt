THE STORY
Bob, Jeremy, and the other 5 coworkers in the Bertram Labs office love coffee. In fact, everyday, right after lunch, they walk down the street to their favorite coffee shop to grab a cup to go. Bob always gets a cappuccino, 
Jeremy likes his coffee black, and the others have their favorite coffee beverage too. To ease the checkout process, only one coworker pays for all the coffees each day. As you can imagine, they have a problem everyday: who's 
turn is it to pay for coffee?

THE CHALLENGE
Write a software program to help the coworkers decide who should pay for coffee. Consider that not all drinks cost the same, so to be fair please take this into account when crafting your solution.

THE REQUIREMENTS
● Choose any programming language you like!
● Create any interface you like (i.e. GUI, CLI,)
● Solution must be published to Github

DELIVERABLES
● Instructions on how to build and run your solution, preferably in a README.
● Document any assumptions you made in creating your program.
● If needed, document how to enter the data required for your program to run. For
example, the coffee consumers, the price for their coffee, etc.
● The finished software solution must be provided to us to run locally or hosted online

We love solving challenging problems at Bertram Labs! We are looking forward to seeing what you come up with.
